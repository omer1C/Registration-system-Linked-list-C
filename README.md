# Registration-system-Linked-list-C
A system to register students for courses, implemented with linked list and dynamically allocated memory.

In this project I use pointers to save memory, hence the data of student and course will allocate only once(even if the student register to more then one couse, it is the same for course that more then one student register to.

All the data is store in sorted liked list, the students list and the course list, also the sub list of student curse list and course student list.

Main menu:
You can choose one of the following options and start update the system:

you can choose every name you want but note that ID need to be unique for each student.

Add a new course:

Here as well you should give a unique course number.

Register student:

By giving the student ID and course number you can register student for a course, now the student will be in the course studetn list and the course will be in the student course list.

Unregister student:

Print list:

With this optios you can see all the data about the students and courses in the system.

In this example we can see that there is also option not to be register for any course and also that the order of the students and courses is by ID and course number.
